# improc-petrsu-webapi
An API for the improc-petrsu library, written using .NET Core and ASP.NET Core.

It utilizes the [`improc-petrsu`](https://gitlab.com/geext/improc-petrsu) library written in Rust and wrapped in a NuGet package. 

To build the project, it's enough to just invoke `dotnet build` in the root directory. A .NET Core SDK is required to build the project. The project targets .NET 5, so at least .NET 5.0 SDK is required.
